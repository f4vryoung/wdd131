			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To give genealogical clients a unique way to connect with their family history. To take the research done for them by a professional genealogist —those names, dates, 
                and places—and transform it into an interactive story. Think of it as a digital storyboard where instead of just facts, the client gets to engage with thier family's 
                history, making those discoveries far more captivating and truly enjoyable.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Genealogy clients and potential clients who are interested in an interactive experience with thier family history.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<ol>
                <li>Clickable Ancestor Cards:
                    <p>What you see: Little boxes on the main page, each with an ancestor's name and photo.</p>
                    <p>What's dynamic: When you click one of those boxes, a whole new section of information for that specific ancestor smoothly appears or slides into view 
                        right there on the page. The page doesn't reload; it just changes what's visible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Expandable "Life Chapters":
                    <p>What you see: Headings like "Early Life," "Marriage," "Career," with an arrow or plus sign next to them.</p>
                    <p>What's dynamic: When you click a heading, the detailed story and photos for that "chapter" of their life appear below it. Clicking again 
                        makes them hide away. It keeps the page neat until you want to dive deeper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Image & Document Pop-up (Gallery Viewer):
                    <p>What you see: Small preview pictures (thumbnails) of old photos or documents.</p>
                    <p>What's dynamic: When you click on a tiny picture, a much larger version of that image or document pops up in the center of the screen, 
                        dimming out the background.</p>
                </li>
                <li>"Show More Details" Buttons:
                        <p>What you see: A little button that says "Show More Facts" or something similar.</p>
                        <p>What's dynamic: When you click it, extra details (maybe birth certificate info, or a list of siblings) that were hidden before will appear.</p>
                </li>
