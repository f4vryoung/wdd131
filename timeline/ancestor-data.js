            bio: `As the seventh of eleven children born to Orson Merritt Terry and Margaret Clements Housekeeper, Fannie Marilla Terry grew up in the small community of Milburn, Utah.  Life in this fledgling, rural town during the 1890’s was difficult with harsh winters, unpredictable weather, and the constant threat of drought. Fannie's family may have found strength to endure in their faith, their extended family and their community.  Fannie, the oldest daughter at home, likely helped her mother with household chores and caring for her younger siblings.  When the town of Milburn built a red brick schoolhouse in 1894, Fannie was the right age to be among eighty-eight pupils who first attended. In 1903, at the age of twenty-two, she married Wilford Moroni Graham in the Manti Temple in Sanpete County, Utah.  The same year a flood forced the residents of Milburn to move away.  Fannie and Wilford settled for a time in Clear Creek, Carbon County, Utah before returning to Milburn around 1905.  Together they had one daughter and six sons. Her tender heart must have broken when her first son, Afton, died of pneumonia at just eight months old. As a tribute to her caring nature, she took in and raised her nephew Orson LeRoy Terry when her brother's wife died in childbirth in January of 1920.  Her own son Fred was just one month old, and it has been said she nursed them together and raised them as twin brothers.  Imagine the worry and pride this mother had when a World War began, and her husband and sons all enlisted in the draft.  Two of her son’s Douglas and Fred served in the military during World War II. While Wilford worked as a foreman for the railroad that ran through town, Fannie likely spent her time keeping house without modern conveniences as electricity didn’t come to Milburn until 1943.  Around 1950 her husband, Wilford, retired, they left Milburn and moved to a farm near Salt Lake City, Utah with their thirty-eight year old son, Ross.  Fannie and Wilford celebrated fifty years of marriage with a Golden Wedding anniversary party in November 1953.  Just a few short months later Wilford passed away at their home on 10 January 1954.  Remaining a widow for the next thirteen years, Fanny would spend her last days in a rest home in Salt Lake City, Utah where she died on 3 May 1967.`,

            bio: `In the bustling city of Philadelphia, on 24 September 1844, Margaret Clement Housekeeper was born to John Housekeeper and Elizabeth Morrow.  Her parents, new converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints brought her to the elders of the church for a children’s blessing on 1 June 1845.  When her parents decided to join the Latter-day Saints who were gathering in Iowa, she was still a small child. Kanesville, modern day Council Bluffs, in Pottawattamie County, Iowa was a known gathering place for Latter-day Saints migrating to Utah. Though the Saints in Kanesville, Iowa knew that the settlement was temporary, they took time to build homes and plant crops.  
                Young Margaret lived in Kanesville until, at seven years old, the Housekeeper family, driven by their faith and the promise of a new life, joined the Harmon-Cutler wagon train in 1852 and started their journey to Utah.  By her sixteenth birthday the family was living in Provo, Utah County, Utah. 
                Margaret married Orson Merritt Terry sometime around 1866, likely near Payson, Utah where they were living with two daughters in 1870.  Orson's service in the Utah Militia during the Indian Wars from 1865 to 1867 often left Margaret and their young children alone as he defended neighboring communities.  Perhaps in the quest for a permanent home, Margaret and Orson joined other pioneering families to settle Dry Creek in 1875, a fledgling community that would later be known as Milburn.  While Margaret would eventually give birth to a total of eleven children, the family was not immune to heartbreak. They lost a six-month-old daughter in the spring of 1874, a three-year-old son was scalded to death in 1882, a seven year old daughter died of croup in 1883, and a twenty-year-old daughter succumbed to typhoid fever in 1889.  Perhaps as a show of faith after all their grief, in 1892 Margaret and Orson had their marriage solemnized in the Manti Temple in Sanpete County.  
                In 1903 a flood of Dry Creek, devastated the community, destroyed homes and properties, and drove the residents to other communities.  Margrett’s family appeared to have migrated north to Salt Lake County as Orson passed away on 29 February 1908 in Brighton.  Margaret and her two youngest sons lived in Hunter, Salt Lake County, Utah in 1910 until they both married.  
                Later Margaret returned to Milburn, where she died on 12 January 1917 of acute gastritis.  Just a few days later, a funeral was conducted at the Milburn schoolhouse, and she was buried in the family plot in Fairview alongside her husband and three of her children.`,

            bio: `Elizabeth Thompson Morrow was said to be born on 26 April 1806 in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.  Not much is known about her early life with her parents James and Sarah Morrow. Her youth was punctuated by the transformation of the fledgling United States in a time of incredible growth and change. Her own transformative years aligned with the “Era of Good Feelings,” a period of peace in American History characterized by a sense of national unity and purpose following the War of 1812.  She married John Housekeeper, a tobacconist from the Philadelphia area in Pennsylvania, around 1836, as their first child was born in 1837.  She was the mother of seven children, however three would die before 1843, a common yet devastating experience. Her first daughter, Sarah Jane, died of hydrocephalus at just fifteen months old in 1841; and in 1843 her son’s George and Joshua died of scarlet fever less than a week apart.  
                Elizabeth and her husband were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  In the following years Elizabeth supported her husband as he served in leadership roles in the Philadelphia Branch of the Church.  Anxious to join with other faithful members of their church and highlighting the commitment to their faith, in late 1847 she gathered her young family and journeyed to Kanesville, Pottawattamie County, Iowa to join with other members of the Church.  Imagine how difficult it must have been to leave her home and three small graves to travel more than 1200 miles with four young children and to start a new life in a new place, and then a few years later to do it all again. 
                In the summer of 1852, Elizabeth, with her husband, gathered her four children and joined the 12th Company of the Harmon-Cutler wagon train on their journey west to the Salt Lake Valley.  Along the way they worshiped, sang songs, and the women washed clothes and baked bread whenever they would stop for a few days.  The company also struggled with illness, foul weather, and fatigue.  After a grueling three-month journey, with four children under the age of thirteen, they arrived on 4 October 1852.  Their travels continued for the next few years as they helped establish the early settlements of Provo and then in Payson City, Utah County, Utah, and along with others contributed to the creation of those communities as farmers.  On 13 January 1869, after about thirty-three years of marriage and more than 2,200 miles together, Elizabeth’s husband John passed away in Payson, leaving her a widow.  In 1890 she and her son Thomas were among the founding families of Milburn.  Twenty-six years after she was widowed, at the ripe age of eighty-nine, she died on 5 May 1895 in the little town of Milburn, Sanpete, Utah where three of her children had settled.`,
